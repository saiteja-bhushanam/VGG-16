 
TASK 2
 
Aim: To create Image Classification model using TF / Keras.
 
Details on the Task:
1.	Create a Custom Neural Network architecture for Image classification for multi-class classification
		a.	Leverage VGG-16, AlexNet, Unet (if possible) as your skeleton architecture.
		b.	Leverage the pre-trained weights to achieve the training results faster.
		c.	Create a custom model for without leveraging pre-trained models.
2.	Create a custom Data loader / Generator
		a.	Try training the model by using Keras’s data loader.
		b.	Create your custom Data loader and train the model.
3.	Save the output weights in a file.
4.	Write and inferencing script
		a.	To accept single image as input and infer
		b.	To accept batch of images and infer
